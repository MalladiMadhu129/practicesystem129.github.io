                             Administratively, Ladakh is divided between
                              Pakistan (northwest), as part of the Northern Areas

                                Jammu and Kashmir state); in addition, 
                                China administers portions of northeastern Ladakh.

                                  <p>Ladakh covers about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km)
                                    and contains the Ladakh Range, which is a southeastern
                                    extension of the Karakoram Range, and the upper
                                         Indus River valley. Ladakh is one of the highest
                                          regions of the world. Its natural features consist
                                           mainly of high plains and deep valleys. The high
                                            plain predominates in the east, diminishing
                                             gradually toward the west. In southeastern Ladakh
                                              lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes
                                               with a uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet
                                                (4,100 metres). To the northwest of Rupshu
                                                 lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region
                                                  where the people and the cattle remain indoors
                                                   for much of the year because of the cold.
                                                    Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, which,
                                                     flowing northward, joins the Indus River below Leh.

                            Kargil’s landscape is mountainous, rugged,
                             and high, the minimum elevation being some
                              8,000 feet (2,440 metres). The climate is
                               cold and dry, with scanty precipitation
                                that falls mainly as snow in winter.
                                 One locality, Dras (Drass), is reputed
                                  to be one of the world’s coldest
                                   permanently inhabited places, with winter
                                    temperatures falling to as low
                                     as −40 °F (−40 °C) or colder. Vegetation,
                                      mainly grasses and shrubs, is largely 
                                      confined to river valleys at lower
                                       elevations, as the higher places are
                                        rocky and largely barren. Most of the
                                         residents of Kargil are of Balti origin,
                                          and the large majority are Shiʿi Muslims.

                            Because of its close proximity to the line
                             of control, Kargil has often been the site
                              of border conflicts between India and Pakistan.
                               The largest and deadliest of these clashes
                                was the Kargil War, which took place in
                                 May–July 1999. In early May the Indian military
                                  learned that Pakistani fighters had infiltrated
                                   Indian-administered territory. The intrusion
                                    triggered intense fighting between the two
                                     sides that lasted more than two months.
                                      The Indian army reclaimed most of the area
                                       on the Indian side that had been occupied
                                        by the infiltrators, and hostilities
                                         finally ended in July when the remaining
                                          Pakistani fighters retreated from the
                                           Indian zone. Several hundred combatants
                                            were killed on each side during the
                                             conflict.

                            Region, in the social sciences, a cohesive
                             area that is homogeneous in selected
                              defining criteria and is distinguished
                               from neighbouring areas or regions by 
                               those criteria. It is an intellectual 
                               construct created by the selection of 
                               features relevant to a particular problem 
                               and the disregard of other features 
                               considered to be irrelevant. A region 
                               is distinguished from an area, which is 
                               usually a broader concept designating a 
                               portion of the surface of Earth. Area 
                               boundaries are arbitrary, established for 
                               convenience. Regional boundaries are 
                               determined by the homogeneity and 
                               cohesiveness of the section.

                            Regions may be nodal, defined by the 
                            organization of activity about some 
                            central place (e.g., a town and its hinterland, 
                            or tributary area), or uniform, defined by the 
                            homogeneous distribution of some phenomena 
                            within it (e.g., a tropical rainforest).

                            Regions may be defined in terms of 
                            single or multiple features or in terms 
                            that approach the total content of human 
                            occupancy of an area. The most common 
                            features in social science are ethnic, 
                            cultural, or linguistic (Provence), 
                            climatic or topographical (the Tennessee Valley), 
                            industrial or urban (the Ruhr), 
                            economic specialization (the Cotton Belt 
                            of North America), administrative units 
                            (standard government regions in Great Britain), 
                            and international political areas (the Middle East).

                            The concept of region is currently used 
                            in analysis, planning, and administration 
                            of many national and international public 
                            programs. Regionalism, or regional consciousness, 
                            the ideological correlate of the concept 
                            that develops from a sense of identity 
                            within the region, is important in many 
                            historical, political, and sociological analyses.
